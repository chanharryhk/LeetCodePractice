hashTables
1. compute key's hashcode
    a. two different keys could have the same hashcode
2. map the hashcode to index in an array
3. linked list of keys and values (incase of collisions)

if collisions are high runtime could be O(N) but if low time is O(1)

arrayList - automatically resizeable
1. when array is full it doubles in size O(N) very rare so O(1)

stringBuilder - 
1. on each concatentation a new copy of string is created
    a. each character is copied over from the two strings
    big O(XN^2)
